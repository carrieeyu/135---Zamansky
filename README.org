* TA Schedule
Below is the Teaching Assistant office schedule. 

Some sessions will be drop in for general help and sometimes there
will be specific topics and materials that the teaching assistants
will go over. If the TA is running an open session on a topic, they
will announce it in the TA stream for the course on Zulip with a link
to join (Zoom, Google Meet etc.). If you're dropping in and there
isn't a session already running, place a message on the TA Zulip
stream for the course and the TA. Support won't always be via live
meeting, it might also happen through the Zulip chat.

* Getting help

Use the cohort mailing lists - daedalus2020 for cohort specific and
daedalus to reach the entire cohort and our Slack channels. Here is a
link to notes on asking for CS help in general. You can also drop in
to any of the TAâ€™s open sessions or the tutoring sessions listed on
the [[https://tong-yee.github.io/135/2020_fall.html][main 135 lecture]] page.

* Lab instructions:
This recitation *will not* be using Gradescope for our labs. Instead,
we are using GitHub Classroom. An email will be sent to the
daedalus2020 mailing list with a link when each lab is
released. Students should:

1. Accept the assignment
2. Clone the repo to their local machine.
3. Complete the lab as instructed

Labs will be graded on the instructors Linux computer so you should be
sure that your solutions will compile and run as instructed on that
platform. Also, only include source files and other files explicitly
asked for in your repository. Do not add executable files (a.out, for
instance) or object (.o) files to the repository.

*Due Dates:* Unless otherwise noted, labs will be released on Mondays
 after class and will be due the Friday morning of that week at
 8:00am.
